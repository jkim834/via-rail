Document your Project in a README.

Notice most code hosting system displays README.
This should be used to give people an overview. 

    Dependencies should be listed here.
    Installation instructions should be listed here.
    If you would like people to contribute,
    those instructions should be listed here.

Apply a License to Your Project.
LICENSE or LICENSE.txt file.

Use Markdown format for the READM file, 
and therefore rename the file to README.md 
to ensure the file is correctly formatted.

'Your project repository as documentation'

Allow developers to have a copy locally,
and will allow them easier access to 
the information instead of having to 
refer to an external wiki page.

Now that your project is in place,
it's time to flip the tables and
look at things from contributor's
perspective.

Let's collaborate!
